Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's [[Help:Using talk pages|talk page]] or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).

Those supporting deletion successfully establish the lack of significant third-party coverage, yet those supporting keeping the article note the success of the business, while it does not make the subject ''inherently'' notable, contributes to an argument thereof, and some argue that there are sufficient sources for inclusion (e.g., Ktr101). However, no one is arguing that the article should be deleted solely because it is of low quality, thus refuting one argument by a supporter of keeping. Ultimately, this discussion has gone on for over a month, and I am unconvinced that another seven days will facilitate reaching a consensus, so I will close this discussion as no consensus with no prejudice against a renomination if additional information on either side manifests itself.

*'''Weak keep''' Mundane topics like roofing supply companies often don't attract much media hype but notability can be sussed from a broad base of sources. Several third party sources identify metrics which I wouldn't consider "trivial" or "incidental" as per [[WP:CORP|the notability guidline on corporations]] and could even be considered inherently notable, such as [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/beacon-roofing-acquire-mcclure-johnston-130251881.html;_ylt=A0LEVxM23VhU2OwAbvBXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzY2RxajU3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1ZJUDUzMl8x almost $100 in annual sales], [http://www.prosalesmagazine.com/news/distributors/beacon-roofing-supply-opens-location-no-200_o opening over 200 stores, recording almost $2 billion in total sales] and being a large, publicly traded company.

But I was unable to find anything in the article itself or this discussion so far that matched it, and the total there is not sufficient. GraniteSand's sources are warmed-over press releases. That the company is NASDAQ-listed does not in my experience demonstrate the existence of good coverage. Still, with a $1B+ market cap, I would guess that coverage may still exist, yet to be found, perhaps in specialized industry periodicals. The topic ''may'' be able to show notability if a sufficiently informed editor has access to appropriate sources and builds an article from them.

R., Jang, W. W., Ultra, V. U. J., & Lee, S. C. (2014). ''Status of tea industry in south asia and the potential and challenges of Nepals tea production and trade''. Journal of the Korean Society of International Agriculture, 26(1), 11-19. http://dx.doi.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/10.12719/KSIA.2014.26.1.11 In [[Nepal]], the Eastern mountainous regions host most of the orthodox (as opposed to crush, tear and curl) tea crops at altitudes approximating 30007000 feet above sea level. Nepal has six districts in which Orthodox tea is produced; Ilam, Dhankuta, Kaski, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok, and Panchthar. Among these districts there are a small number of medium-to-large scale tea estates as well as a large number of small holder farmers. Once the tea plant reaches maturity, its leaves can be harvested around four to five times a year, for many years. The different harvests of tea are called flushes. In Nepal there are four separate flushes in a growing season; first flush, second flush, monsoon flush, and autumn flush.UPASI TRF. (2014). ''Orthodox''. Tamil Nadu, INDIA: UPASI TEA RESEARCH FOUNDATION. http://www.upasitearesearch.org/orthodox/ == History == The Nepalese tea industry was established in large part by the East India Companys colonization of India. The most reputable region of [[India]] for tea, Darjeeling, introduced hybrid tea plants to Nepal in the mid 1800s. Tea estates became established in the Nepalese regions. Later into the 1900s the Nepalese tea producers acted as suppliers to Darjeeling factories when tea bushes became old and yields decreased. Orthodox tea now provides a source of sustainability for almost 20 000 farmers in Nepal. Farmers are supported by the National Tea and Coffee Development Board created by the Nepalese Ministry of Agriculture.NTCDB. (2013). ''Orthodox tea''. Nepal: National Tea and Coffee Development Board. http://www.teacoffee.gov.np/ A national tea policy was introduced by the NTCDB in 2000 which aimed to create more access to credit and land for farmers producing tea. == Pesticide use == In terms of pesticide use, there is no Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) in place.Koirala, P., Dhakal, S., & Tamrakar, A. S. (2009). ''Pesticide application and food safety issue in Nepal''. The Journal of Agriculture and Environment, 10, 111-114. http://www.cabi.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/isc/FullTextPDF/2010/20103317788.pdf However, in the last decade numerous poisonous chemicals such as monocrotophos, quinalphos, ethion, and phorate have been prohibited (as of May 2005). An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is becoming more popular as an alternative to pesticide application. The IPM approach includes the use of bio fertilizers, vermin-compost, and organic farming. The lack of internal regulation of pesticide use adversely affects the commodity in terms of trade potential. ==Economic benefits == The transition from subsistence farming to cash crop farming of orthodox tea provides a benefit to hillside farmers in terms of financial support and involvement in the domestic market. Many traditional farmers have given up subsistence farming and now specialize in solely growing tea. The profits that come from selling tea can then be used to purchase staple foods in a domestic market. The switch from traditional farming to cash cropping has reduced poverty rates among small holder farmers in tea growing. 70% of orthodox tea produced in Nepal in 2006 was by small. Orthodox tea is a profitable crop that is unique to hillside farmers. Forecasts by the NTCDB predict that by 2022 orthodox tea exports will reach 27 million kg, compared to the 2012 figure of 3 million kg. The paired growth in the tea sector will employ approximately 100 000 people. Engagement in over-seas markets will allow Nepali tea producers to capitalize on their products high quality and value as a niche product. Nepali orthodox tea is being sold well below premium to bordering countries such as India. A metric ton of Nepali green tea is valued at $1180 in India, but $12000 in the USA. Thus, in order for Nepali farmers and producers of orthodox tea to make the most money from this crop there is a need to export to countries like the USA who pay premium prices for the product. ==Value-added and organic farming== The United States Department of International Development recommended increasing the productivity of tea cultivation in Nepal by updating the out of date machinery that most processing factories currently use.Walker, D. (2011). ''Nepali tea assessment'' : Nepal, economic, agriculture, and trade activity. ( No. AID-367-TO-11-00001).United States Agency for International Development. http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JH33.pdf Other interventions proposed include the introduction of motorized pruning devices to reduce labour and increase productivity with respect to time. A more recent obstacle that is limiting small farmers is the issue of pesticide use and achieving organic certification. The belief in Nepal is that becoming a certified organic farmer, a costly and time consuming process, will yield significant increases in profit However, with organic tea production, yields decrease and labour increases significantly during initial stages of adaptation. In the end, the major problem for most tea farmers in Nepal is that they occupy the primary or secondary industry. Small tea farmers do not have the means to add value to their tea through processing and packaging, they rely on outside agents to purchase their bulk leaves.Mohan, S. (2013). ''Institutions and livelihoods in Nepals tea value chain''.

This would be for editing drafts or personal pages where no edit summary is necessary. And is there a way to keep the visual editor menu at the top even after saving, so that when we're far down on a page we don't have to scroll back up (or use the cumbersome shortcut keys) to visual edit again ? [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 14:26, 30 November 2014 (UTC) :Also, can we through personal js or otherwise change "Edit source" to "Edit" and "Edit beta" to "Visual edit" ? [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 15:19, 30 November 2014 (UTC) ::{{Replyto|Cenarium}} Regarding your second question, are there not "Edit source" and "Edit beta" links immediately to the right of ''every'' section heading? These are intended to avoid the problem you describe - having to go to the top of the page to start an editing session. (And since VE doesn't do section-only editing, clicking on "Edit beta", ''anywhere on a page'', opens the entire page for editing with VE.) -- [[User:John Broughton|John Broughton]] [[User talk:John Broughton |(??)]] 04:41, 1 December 2014 (UTC) :::{{ping|John Broughton}} Yes, but there are pages with no sections (or large sections), which isn't often the case for articles but more so for non-article pages (the need was most obvious when I was editing a page like that). There is also that one still has to click on this section editing button, which could be avoided, especially considering the time it takes to load visual editor. So a way to save the changes without leaving visual editor would be most welcome. [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 06:05, 1 December 2014 (UTC) [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]], I think that you want the [[WP:keyboard shortcuts#List_of_access_keys|keyboard shortcuts]], which work anywhere on the page. You can change almost any label through CSS. Last I checked, there were no basic help pages to help editors figure out how to do this for themselves, but an inquiry at [[WP:VPT]] is usually successful. This link will show you the names of the objects that you want to change: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Candy&uselang=qqx There is no way to skip the invitation to provide an edit summary, and I'm certain that this is a WONTFIX issue with the product manager. [[User:Whatamidoing (WMF)|Whatamidoing (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Whatamidoing (WMF)|talk]]) 10:35, 3 December 2014 (UTC) :{{reply to|Whatamidoing (WMF)}} Shortcuts won't do. I want to remain in visual editor mode after the save. I make edits, I save my edits without leaving visual editor, I edit again, and so on. It would make editing easier and faster, having to use shortcuts is too much of a hassle and it takes too long for visual editor to load. So I think it's a feature that would be very helpful and appreciated, particularly by experienced users. I would suggest a checkbox "stay in visual editor mode after saving". (I would even suggest to have a "visual editor always on" option in preferences, but only further down the line, when performance will have improved.) :Thanks, I know how to hide in css but not how to change a label, so I'll ask at VPT (and I'll update [[WP:CSS#Tips_and_tricks]]). I've tried to hide the edit summary help, minor edit and watch checkboxes and the copyright warning of the window though, and couldn't using css, despite them being hidden in source editing. Is it not possible yet ? :I was not suggesting skipping the window as a feature request, but as something that 'power' users could do using personal js. I've thought of something better though : :I would strongly suggest to offer an option to have the edit summary window and minor edit checkbox (everything else is superfluous, or should be allowed to be hidden) together with the edit window, as in source editing. I see two possibilities, both could be offered and the user would choose according to their preference (mostly based on abundance of vertical space versus horizontal space on their respective platform). Either right below the visual editor menu toolbar, or in another box on the left side of the window where the navigation bar takes lots of unused space. Once again, it's something that could be very appreciated by experienced users, contributing to a wider acceptance of visual editor. [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 14:41, 3 December 2014 (UTC) :Just a follow up on relabeling, I don't think this can be done in css, but I've done so in js, using the following : $( 'a', '#ca-edit' ).text( 'Edit' ); $( 'a', '#ca-ve-edit' ).text( 'Visual edit' ) ;. For sections, the visual edit link was harder to replace and I had to use $( 'a', '.mw-editsection' ).text( 'Edit section' ); $( '.mw-editsection-visualeditor' ).html( 'Visual edit' ); . [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 21:51, 3 December 2014 (UTC) :Okay, I've been able to hide the edit summary help, minor edit and watch checkboxes and the copyright warning.

When working on an article, editors tend to make several edits in succession rather than a big one for several reasons, the main of those being edit conflicts. This would matter even more in visual editor since resolving conflicts would presumably require wikitext editing, which would defeat the purpose of said visual editor. So there should be a way to save without leaving, the visual editor window should update with the user's edit (and non-conflicting edits by other users). :::I've tried using custom js to reload the visual editor immediately after leaving it, as a script for wikitext editor does, but couldn't get js to work with visual editor, see section below.

Either it does nothing, or it loads for ever. On the other hand, css works fine. First, how can we check that we're in visual editor mode ? It's been discussed at bugzilla, mainly that visual editor uses "veaction=edit" instead of "action=vedit" which would have allowed wgAction to work. Is there a workaround ? Doing this by testing if a visual editor ui element exists does nothing, and not testing results in an infinite loop.

Tiki taka is his playing style, one may say that the attacking middle fielder is not much of a dribbler but rather makes it up with accurate short passes that create scoring chances. As a youth, he played for Set Green Hills academy, park center high school , PSC Soccer Academy and Prairie seeds academy. Before joining FC Minneapolis Mumbo played with Portugal FC as a middle fielder. He later on joined the Czechoslovakia side, SK Aritma Praha until when he suffered a fatal knee injury that saw him return to the US in the spring of 2014 to sign a Pro Transition Contract with FC Minneapolis. "Mumbo is a promising player so full of football and mystery. I just can't wait to see what he's going to become here at FC Minneapolis" Smith said.

In Irish, its name has been given as ''An Chúileann'' or ''An Chúilfhionn'' ("the fair haired girl" or "the fair lady") depending on the text used. The tune is also known as "The Lady of the Desert". ==History== The air, and the texts fitted to it, have a long and very complex history. Its exact provenance is unknown, but it has been variously asserted by different authors as dating from the 13th century, from the time of [[Henry VIII]], or from the 17th century, though the latter is the most credible.Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12 There are at least two main Irish language texts and a number of later English translations, or interpretations of both; there are also English words (such as those by [[Thomas Moore|Moore]]) which are not a translation of either Irish version. ===The air=== The air itself is sometimes claimed to have been composed by [[Turlough O'Carolan|Carolan]], though John Glen (1900) said that the "ancient Irish melody" was in fact usually known as "Molly St George" at the beginning of the 18th century.Glen, J. ''Early Scottish melodies: including examples from mss. and early printed works'', AMS, 1900, p.218 The latter-named tune has been often been associated with the great 17th-century harper [[Thomas Connellan]]. Connellan was also cited alongside Carolan as a possible composer of The Coolin, but as Glen noted, many supposed "that the tune is older than either of them". The version of The Coolin printed by [[Edward Bunting]] in ''The Ancient Music of Ireland '' (1840) was taken from the playing of [[Donnchadh Ó Hámsaigh]] (Dennis Hempson), who himself claimed to have learned it from the playing of [[Cornelius Lyons]] early in the previous century. Though Bunting's setting claims to present the tune with variations, it in fact appears to print only Lyons' once-fashionable baroque variations while omitting the main tune.''Journal of the Irish folk Song Society'', v1-2, Wm. Dawson, 1967, p.32 [[Patrick Weston Joyce]], who said that Bunting's version was "wanting in simplicity", printed a version of the tune collected from the playing of a fiddler, Hugh O'Beirne, that he said was very similar to that he recalled being sung in his youth in 1830s [[County Limerick]].Joyce, ''Old Irish Folk Music and Songs'', 1909, p.299 Other versions appeared in several late 18th century collections, as well as in the 1795 opera ''The Wicklow Mountains'', written by [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keeffe]] with music by [[William Shield]]. ===Claimed 13th or 16th century origins=== These suggestions originated with [[Joseph Cooper Walker]], who said in his ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'' (1786) that the air's title in fact referred to what he called the "coulins", or long locks of hair, worn by Irish men and which were prohibited by a statute of [[Henry VIII]], although he noted that no actual words to the air on this subject had survived.Walker, J. C. ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'', Payne, 1786, p.134 Despite the lack of a text, Walker's assertion was repeated by, amongst others, [[Laurence F. Renehan|Renehan]] and [[W. H. Grattan Flood]]: Flood however proposed (based on a suggestion by Lynch in a letter to the ''Dublin Penny Journal'') the air must refer to an earlier statute of the 13th century. The story inspired a 19th-century patriotic poem called ''The Coulin Forbidden'', written by W. B. McBurney under the pseudonym "Carroll Malone". [[File:Eugene OCurry-Social England 1904-p889-with-header.jpg|thumbnail|right|The distinguished philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] believed that the air known as The Coolin was first given that name in the early 18th century by a Fr. Oliver O'Hanley.]] The philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] asserted, however, that the title "The Coolin" was only applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a priest, Fr. Oliver O'Hanley, to set a poem he wrote in praise of a famous beauty of [[County Limerick]].O'Curry, E. Note XXVI to Griffin, G. ''The Invasion'', 1895, p.586 In this case, O'Curry commented, the word "Coolin" is used in its sense "fair-haired one", to refer to a girl: he disagrees with Walker, stating "no such word was ever, or ever could have been, applied to the ''glibbs'', or long tufts of back hair, prohibited by old English statute". The Rev. L. Donnellan, in a survey of the various texts and tunes of The Coolin, published in the 1912 ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', was equally dismissive: he states that Walker's "credulous" story of it referring to an English statute was "fabricated by his friend [William] Beauford".Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12 He also notes that what he called Walker's "foolish speculation" was encouraged by his insertion of the phrase "glibbs and coulins" into the 16th century statute, which he notes only refers to proscribed "glibbs". Donnellan's conclusion was that the original composition was a 17th-century one attributed to O Duagain (see below). ===Text attributed to O Duagain=== The oldest and best-known Irish text definitely associated with the tune is a love-poem addressed to a fair-haired girl (''chúilfhionn''); this is attributed to a poet called Muiris O Duagain or Maurice O'Dugan of [[Benburb]] and said to have been written in around 1641.Hardiman, James. ''Irish minstrelsy, or Bardic remains of Ireland'', v.1, 1831, p.349 English translations of this text have been written by Sir [[Samuel Ferguson]] (beginning "O have you seen the Coolun") and [[Thomas Furlong (poet)|Thomas Furlong]], amongst others. The latter was printed by [[James Hardiman]], along with O Duagain's original text, in his collection ''Irish Minstrelsy'' (1831). A version of O Duagain of Benburb's poem was also printed, with translations, in [[Douglas Hyde]]'s ''Love Songs of Connacht'' (1893), with the first line ''A's éirigh do shuidhe a bhuachaill a's gleus dam mo ghearrán'' ("And rise up lad, and get ready for me my nag"). Hyde omits two stanzas already printed by Hardiman, and describes this as a version collected in [[Connacht]].Hyde, ''Love Songs of Connacht'', 1893, pp.69-70 Donnellan, after dismissing Walker, Grattan Flood and O'Curry's other suggestions, states that the probability "is that O'Dugan of Benburb did compose a poem with this air perhaps substantially the same as the different versions given by Hardiman, Vol. I., p. 251 ; O'Daly, p. 155 ; and Dr. Hyde, pp. 70-73 in the ''Love Songs of Connacht''". ===Text attributed to O'Hanley=== Writing in the early 1800s, O'Curry said that the title "The Coolin" was first applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a poet, Father Oliver O'Hanley (fl. 1700-1750), to set an Irish-language poem he had written in praise of Nelly O'Grady, a celebrated beauty of [[County Limerick]]. This text, beginning ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe'' ("A honey mist on a day of frost, in a dark oak wood"), and which is addressed to ''Neilidh'' ("Nelly") was printed by Hyde, who said it was written in a manuscript originating in [[County Clare]], though the manuscript was partly damaged and he could not read two stanzas. ===Other texts=== Hyde noted the existence of what he called a Munster version of the poem, given in O'Daly's ''The poets and poetry of Munster'' (1850). This shares some material with that attributed to O Duagain, but is only three stanzas long and includes a reference to a member of the Power family.O'Daly, J. ''The Poets and Poetry of Munster: A Selection of Irish Songs by the Poets of the Last Century'', 1850, pp.124-125 Another well-known text was written for the air in English by the poet [[Thomas Moore]], usually known by its first line ''Though the last glimpse of Erin''. It is not a translation of any of the earlier Irish versions. Donnellan noted that the version of the air used by Moore was substantially "correct and unaltered", particularly in comparison to Bunting's, when compared with early 19th and late 18th century copies of the tune, though it still showed some evidence of having been adapted by an "instrumentalist".Donnellan, 12, 13 ==Text== The following is the early 19th century translation of O Duagain's text by Ferguson: :O have you seen the Coolun, :Walking down the cuckoo's street, :With the dew of the meadow shining :On her milk-white twinkling feet! :My love she is, and my ''coleen oge'', :And she dwells in Bal'nagar; :And she bears the palm of beauty bright, :From the fairest that in Erin are. :In Bal'nagar is the Coolun :Like the berry on the bough her cheek; :Bright beauty dwells for ever :On her fair neck and ringlets sleek; :Oh, sweeter is her mouth's soft music :Than the lark or thrush at dawn, :Or the blackbird in the greenwood singing :Farewell to the setting sun. :Rise up, my boy! make ready :My horse, for I forth would ride, :To follow the modest damsel, :Where she walks on the green hillside; :Where since our youth were we plighted, :In faith, troth, and wedlock true - :She is sweeter to me nine times over, :Than organ or cuckoo! :For, ever since my childhood :I loved the fair and darling child; :But our people came between us, :And with lucre our pure love defiled; :Ah, my woe it is, and my bitter pain, :And I weep it night and day, :That the ''coleen bawn'' of my early love, :Is torn from my heart away. :Sweetheart and faithful treasure, :Be constant still and true; :Nor for want of herds and houses :Leave one who would ne'er leave you, :I'll pledge you the blessed Bible, :Without and eke within, :That the faithful God will provide for us, :Without thanks to kith or kin. :Oh, love, do you remember :When we lay all night alone, :Beneath the ash in the winter storm :When the oak wood round did groan? :No shelter then from the blast had we, :The bitter blast or sleet, :But your gown to wrap about our heads, :And my coat around our feet.''The Book of Irish Ballads: Edited by Denis Florence M'Carthy'', James Duffy, 1846, p.188 ==Historic performances== The Coolin was a popular part of the Irish harp repertoire of the 18th century. [[Charles Fanning (harper)|Charles Fanning]] won first prize at the [[Belfast Harp Festival]] of 1792 with a performance of The Coolin, repeating his success at the earlier [[Granard]] harp festivals with the same tune.[http://billhaneman.ie/AIH/MemoirsOfArthurONeill.html The Memoirs of Arthur O'Neill], Chapter XVI Bunting appears to have disapproved of Fanning's performance at Belfast, noting that he "was not the best performer, but he succeeded in getting the first prize by playing 'The Coolin' with modern variations, a piece of music at the time much in request by young practitioners on the piano-forte".Bunting, quoted in O'Neill, F. ''Irish Minstrels and Musicians'', 1913, p.84 After the decline of Irish harping in the early 19th century, the air became equally popular as an instrumental piece with fiddle players and [[uilleann pipes|pipers]]. Recordings of The Coolin exist by [[Leo Rowsome]], [[Johnny Doran]] and [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]], amongst others. ==Samuel Barber setting== The composer [[Samuel Barber]] published a setting of The Coolin in 1942 for unaccompanied chorus, based on a text originally published by [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] in the collection ''Reincarnations''.Heyman, B. ''Samuel Barber'', OUP, 1992, p.182 Stephens said that his poem, "The Coolun", was based on another by "[[Antoine Ó Raifteiri|Raftery]]",Stephens, ''Reincarnations'', Macmillan, 1918 but seems to bear some similarity to parts of the O'Hanley text ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe''. ==References== {{reflist}} [[Category:Irish songs]] [[Category:Year of song unknown]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Coolin}}", "[[Category:Chicago Board of Trade|Litigation]] [[Category:United States cases by party]]", "#REDIRECT [[Unionist Party (Punjab)]]", " {{User:COIBot/Summary/SpecificReports}} {{User:COIBot/linksaverdatabases|||||}} {{NOINDEX}}[[Category:Local COIBot Reports|gordonnapier.com]] == Links == * {{LinkSummary|gordonnapier.com}} :* gordonnapier.com resolves to [//118.139.171.1 118.139.171.1] :*: {{LinkSummary|118.139.171.1}} :* Link is not on the [[en:User:COIBot#Blacklist|blacklist]]. :* Link is not on the [[en:User:COIBot#Domainredlist|domainredlist]]. :* Link is not on the [[en:User:COIBot#Monitorlist|Monitorlist]]. :* None of the mentioned users is on the [[en:User:COIBot#Blacklist|blacklist]]. :* Link is not on the [[en:User:COIBot#Whitelist|whitelist]]. :* Link is not on the [[en:User:COIBot#Monitor list|monitor list]]. == Users == * {{UserSummary|Melisamahtab}} == Selected additions == {{User:COIBot/Additionlist_top}} {{User:COIBot/EditSummary|id=43870894|lang=en|wikidomain=w|namespace=|pagename=The Matrix|username=Melisamahtab|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages|sortdomain=com.gordonnapier.|domain=gordonnapier.com|origdiff=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=642518081&oldid=641992671|resolved=X|isIP=0|date=2015-01-14|time=22:24:57|wiki=en.wikipedia.org|revid=642518081|oldid=641992671|whitelisted=0|blacklisteduser=0|whitereason=|blackreason=|usercount=11|top=0|deleted=0|there=1|checked=1|coiflag=0|otherlinks={{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages/|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages/|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages/|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages/|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}}} {{User:COIBot/EditSummary|id=43875904|lang=en|wikidomain=w|namespace=|pagename=The Matrix|username=Melisamahtab|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages/|sortdomain=com.gordonnapier.|domain=gordonnapier.com|origdiff=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=642525526&oldid=642524066|resolved=X|isIP=0|date=2015-01-14|time=23:33:11|wiki=en.wikipedia.org|revid=642525526|oldid=642524066|whitelisted=0|blacklisteduser=0|whitereason=|blackreason=|usercount=11|top=0|deleted=0|there=1|checked=1|coiflag=0|otherlinks={{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages/|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}{{User:COIBot/OtherLinks|link=gordonnapier.com/the-matrix-the-heros-journey-stages/|domain=gordonnapier.com|U=11|L=11|UL=11|WUL=0}}}} {{User:COIBot/Additionlist_bottom}} * Displayed 2 additions out of 2 total.

[[File:Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.JPG|thumb|Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]] '''History''' The king of Poland [[Wladyslaw IV Vasa]] (Polish: Wladyslaw IV Waza) founded the first church in Bielanski Forest as a vote of gratitude for royal election the crown and wining in the Smolensk campaign. The church had to be situated in a remote area according to the [[Camaldolese]]s tradition and it was built on the area of former village Pólko (now Bielany). In 1669-1710 and 1733-1755 the church was rebuilt, the founders of the project were Polish kings [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] (Polish: Jan II Kazimierz Waza) and [[Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki|Michael I]] (Polish: Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki). During the 19th century Poland was under partitions. After the fall of the [[January Uprising]] in 1864, Tsarist occupation authorities liquidated all Camaldoles monasteries with the exception of the Warsaw. In the next years Russian authorities took over some of the buildings. The Russian introduced a ban on the admission of new members. After that the church and hermitages were taken over by the Russian Red Cross. In 1905 there was created a parish and the church was renovated. After Russians withdrawal from Warsaw in 1914 there was form an orphanage run by Sisters. In 1916 seminar was launched and in 1918 there was created junior high school. For the purposes it was erected a new building placed in the former foresterium. Nowadays the church and the hermitage huts are preserved in original state. After the destructions of the 2nd World War and burning down of the gymnasium building the former monastery buildings were redesigned by the ATK (Catholic Theology Academy), now UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University), and in the site of the hostelry and the remnants of the gymnasium building there is a modern seminary building being erected by the Warsaw Archdiocese. '''Architecture'''
[[File:Plan of the Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.jpg|thumb|Plan of the Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]] Standing in front of the facade of the church we are exactly on the axis of the monastic complex. It is point out by the wooden cross standing at today Dewajtis street. From the setting of that cross in 1693 began to pave the grounds of the monastery. The monastery complex consists of a gate, church, 13 hermitages and foresterium. According to Mariusz Karpowicz the church was designed by Italian architect Isidoro Affaitati. '''''Facade''''' Facade was erected when the church with the main body had been already built. Designer of that late Baroque works could be a Roman architect [[Gaetano Chiaveri]]. The facade is triaxle - the central part is a little forward of and topped with a tympanum, enclosed in a pair of composite pilasters and columns. We can observe here two architectural styles late Baroque and early Classicism. The first of them we can see in the details and the second one in the central part and columns. In the side niches are set two wooden polychrome sculptures. The first shows [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] and the second one [[Romuald|Saint Romuald]]. '''''Interior''''' Interior decorations are in rococo style. the church has an octagonal plan cut by cross. Presbytery is a double span, closed semicircular. There is an octagonal nave, which cut transept by transverse axis. The transept is made by two symmetrical chapels. We can observe a great sailing vault. On the diagonal axes are four chapels lower than those which determine presbytery. Consistency adds fact that whole interior has part of Corinthian style for example columns. Between the chapels there are placed narrow passages. '''''Hermitages'''''
[[File:Gate to hermitages - Church of Camaldoleses in Warsaw.JPG|thumb|Hermitage Gate, Camaldolese Church, Warsaw]] Walking around the church, we can see 13 [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitages]]. They are arranged in four parallel rows on either side of the central axis formed. Between houses connected by low walls fences are situated gardens. All hermitages have the same interior. In the center there is cross-vaulted hall, on the one side there is a cell and small utility room, on the other side we can see chapel and woodshed. '''Nowadays''' At present near the church there is junior high school, high school and UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University). Now the church is also a kind of cultural center. The concerts and theatrical performances take place in the crypt, there is also a café. There are several attractions for children such as wooden carousel and a donkey. The church is attractive both for local society and tourists. '''Bibliography:''' * Maria Brykowska, Kosciól Kamedulów na Bielanach, Warszawa: Wyd. PWN, 1982 * Ks.

[[List of Fringe episodes|List of ''Fringe'' episodes]] | Prev = [[Johari Window (Fringe)|Johari Window]] | Next = [[The Bishop Revival]] }} "'''What Lies Below'''" is the 13th [[List of Fringe episodes|episode]] of the [[Fringe (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction]] [[drama]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''. Set in a [[quarantine]]d [[Boston]] office building, the episode revolves around a thousands-year-old [[virus]] that infects and then influences its victims to attempt to spread the contagion outside of the building. It was the third ''Fringe'' episode to be written by supervising producer [[Jeff Vlaming]], while it was director [[Deran Sarafian]]'s only credit for the series to date. After his character becomes infected, actor [[Joshua Jackson]] commented during shooting to "just imagine the worst hangover I've ever had and multiply it by ten". "What Lies Below" first aired in the United States on January 21, 2010 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]. An estimated 6.90 million viewers watched the episode, and it received mixed reviews from critics, with one calling it average and predictable. ==Plot== In [[Boston]], a visibly sick man from the [[Netherlands]] arrives at an office building, only to collapse and die. The veins in his body erupt with blood, spraying surrounding witnesses. The Fringe team arrive on site, and while interviewing the witnesses, another man also becomes sick. The sick man attempts to leave the building, only to be stopped by [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]), who sees the man spray out blood and realizes there is a [[Infectious disease|contagion]]. The building is [[Quarantine|quarantined]] with Walter's son [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]), FBI agent [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]] ([[Anna Torv]]), and the rest of the witnesses still inside. The [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]] arrives and soon clash with Walter, who wants some blood samples to take back to his lab at [[Harvard]]. As another witness, the receptionist, falls ill, the rest begin panicking that the virus is an airborne contagion. Olivia discovers that the Dutch man was an oil consultant who arrived to meet with Mr. Ames, one of the other office workers trapped in the building. Walter explains that viruses have forms of "personalities," that influence their hosts to act in certain ways. He posits that the virus is not airborne after all, but needs more samples for further tests. Meanwhile the infected receptionist is influenced by the virus, jumps out a window, and also scares Peter into falling into an infected pool of blood. The woman is sprayed with decontaminate spray, as Peter quickly rinses himself off. Knowing he is likely infected, Peter searches through the Dutch man's pockets, leading to the discovery of a briefcase infected by the virus. Walter continues his theory that the virus wants to escape the building, hence the multiple escape attempts by the infected. The virus was found on a sample taken 10 miles below the earth, and may be 75,000 years old and responsible for wiping out the [[Ice Age]] [[mammals]]. As a [[bio-hazard]] team enters the building to test people for the virus, a CDC official orders the army to prepare for a "level six eradication", because they still do not know how to contain it. Peter manages to fake the test and hide his infection. He and Olivia begin leading a team of healthy people outside the building, but before Peter is able to leave, his nose bleeds, clearly revealing that he is infected. While the virus overtakes Peter's health and sanity, Walter becomes increasingly distressed as he fears losing his son again, and accidentally blurts out that he "can't let Peter die again" to [[Astrid Farnsworth|Astrid]] ([[Jasika Nicole]]). Despite the threat of eradication and death, he and Astrid remain in the building to run further tests on the Dutch man. Walter realizes that [[sulfuric]] ash killed the virus thousands of years ago, and successfully finds a cure with some [[horseradish]] he found in the office break room. The CDC agrees to allow Olivia to enter the building and use the air ventilation system to spread some fentanyl gas, which will gain them time while the cure is synthesized. While inside, Peter attacks her, but Olivia is able to turn the air on, successfully knocking out the building's occupants. Peter and everyone else are successfully cured. Astrid later approaches Walter and asks what he meant when he said he couldn't let Peter die again, to which he responds by saying "some things are meant to be left alone." ==Production== [[File:Fringe Panel 3 2010 CC.jpg|right|thumb|[[Peter Bishop]], played by actor [[Joshua Jackson]] ''(pictured left)'' becomes infected with an ancient virus in the episode.]] Supervising producer [[Jeff Vlaming]] wrote "What Lies Below", his second episode of the season.{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jeff-vlaming/credits/243586 |title=Jeff Vlaming: Credits |last= |first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}} Filmmaker [[Deran Sarafian]] served as the director,{{cite web|url=http://sfscope.com/2010/01/black-oil-reduxfringes-what-li.html |title=Black Oil ReduxFringe's "What Lies Beneath"|last=Stegall |first=Sarah |publisher=[[SFScope]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-05-25}} his first and only ''Fringe'' directional credit.{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/deran-sarafian/credits/188874 |title=Deran Sarafian: Credits |last= |first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}} The episode featured one-time guest appearances by actors [[Demore Barnes]], [[Geoff Pierson]], [[Conrad Coates]], [[Natassia Malthe]], and [[David Richmond-Peck]].{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/fringe-2010/episode-13-season-2/lies/293813 |title=Fringe Episode: "What Lies Below" |last=|first=|work=[[TV Guide]] |date=|accessdate=2011-05-25}} Actor [[Joshua Jackson]], who plays an infected [[Peter Bishop]] in the episode, noted during shooting that he found inspiration from "imagin[ing] the worst hangover I've ever had and multiply it by ten".{{cite video |people=[[Anna Torv]], [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Deran Sarafian]], Michael Mitchell, Bob Comer, Angela Uyeda |date=2010 |title=Analyzing the Scene for "What Lies Below"| medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] Television |location=''Fringe: The Complete Second Season'' Disc 3 }} Actress [[Jasika Nicole]] was pleased that the writers decided to let her character discover Walter's secret, commenting "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I think that it was really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has to step up to the plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that."{{cite video |people=[[Anna Torv]], [[Akiva Goldsman]], [[J.J. Abrams]], [[Jeff Pinkner]], [[J. H.

To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== The first airing of "What Lies Below" was watched by an estimated 6.90 million viewers in the United States, with a 2.6/7 rating for those aged 1849.{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/22/tv-ratings-thursday-deep-end-underwater-bones-annual-high-csi-mentalist-greys-series-lows/39739/|title=TV Ratings Thursday: ''Deep End'' Underwater; ''Bones'' High; ''CSI'', ''Mentalist'', ''Grey's'' Series Lows|last=Gorman|first=Bill|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-01-30}} [[SFScope]] writer Sarah Stegall considered these numbers to be "steady but stagnant ratings", as they were "not much different" from the [[Johari Window (Fringe)|previous week]]. ===Reviews=== "What Lies Below" received mixed reviews from television critics. ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' contributor Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that despite some nice moments, it was "an episode of the show that started out utterly predictably, continued along an utterly predictable path and yet somehow got fairly enjoyable by the end just through sheer force of will on the part of the cast."{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/what-lies-below,37379/ |title="What Lies Below" |last=VanDerWerff |first=Todd|work=[[The A.V.

Like many other critics, Isler thought the episode was too similar to ''[[The X-Files]]'', and gave it 7.0/10.{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/106/1062874p1.html |title=Fringe: "What Lies Below" Review |last=Isler |first=Ramsey |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2010-01-22|accessdate=2011-01-30}} [[TV Squad]] columnist Jane Boursaw thought Walter discovering a cure was a little far-fetched, and wished Broyles was a greater part of the show.{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/01/22/review-fringe-what-lies-below-recap/ |title=Review: Fringe - What Lies Below |last=Boursaw|first=Jane|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-01-30}} ''[[Television Without Pity]]'' gave the episode a B+.{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/fringe/what_lies_below_1.php |title=Maybe All I Need is a Shot in the Arm |last=MacEachern |first=Daniel |work=[[Television Without Pity]]|date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-30}} Andrew Hanson from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' thought it was a really good episode, and even wished it could have been turned into a movie, were ''Fringe'' to get into filmmaking.{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/fringe-confinement.html |title='Fringe': Confinement |last=Hanson |first=Andrew|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-01-30}} Josh Wigler of [[MTV]] thought it was a "pretty cool" mystery-of-the-week, and "while not quite as strong as when the mythology is in full gear, 'What Lies Below' was nonetheless a compelling hour of television."

The [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War | unrest]] began in the early spring of 2011 within the context of [[Arab Spring]] protests, with nationwide protests against President [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s government, whose forces responded with violent crackdowns. The conflict gradually developed from popular protests to an armed rebellion after months of military sieges.{{cite news | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/22/bombardment-syria-s-homs-kills-21-people.html |title= Bombardment of Syria's Homeless kills 21 people| first1 =Khaled Yacoub | last1 = Oweis | first2 = Erika | last2 = Solomon|agency=Reuters|date=22 February 2012 | accessdate =21 July 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2014}} The armed opposition consists of various groups that were formed during the course of the conflict, mostly the [[Free Syrian Army]], which was the first to take up arms in 2011, and the [[Islamic Front (Syria) |Islamic Front]] formed in 2013.

Facing international sanctions, the Syrian government relied on criminal organizations to smuggle goods and money in and out of the country. The economic downturn caused by the conflict and sanctions also led to lower wages for Shabiha members. In response, some Shabiha members began stealing civilian properties, and engaging in kidnappings. Rebel forces sometimes relied on criminal networks to obtain weapons and supplies. Black market weapon prices in Syria's neighboring countries have significantly increased since the start of the conflict. To generate funds to purchase arms, some rebel groups have turned towards extortion, stealing, and kidnapping. ===Cultural heritage=== {{main|List of heritage sites damaged during Syrian civil war}} The civil war has caused significant damage to Syria's cultural heritage, including [[World Heritage Site]]s.

(19101990) was widely recognized by the engineering community and known for his innovative [[structural engineering]] solutions, as a senior assistant engineer and [[lieutenant]] with the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defense]], a professor at the [[University of Toronto]], as co-founder of the North American firm [[Morrison Hershfield]], and as a prolific author. He was a lifelong advocate of education and the engineering profession. ==Early life and education== Hershfield' parents Aaron and Molly Hershfield left Teofipol, [[Ukraine]] in the mid-1890s for [[Manitoba, Canada]] in search of greater opportunities and in the hopes of starting a family. On December 24, 1910 their son Charles Hershfield was born. As a child and later in his teens, Hershfield's interests resided in music, [[baseball]], [[carpentry]], and [[mechanical engineering]]. He attended St. Johns High School in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, and even from a young age, highly valued his education. Hershfield later studied engineering at the [[University of Manitoba]]. Working with two of his classmates, H.F. Peters and W. Gruber, Hershfield submitted the thesis Some Tests of Welded Joints. Hershfield graduated in 1930 with the degree of [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[civil engineering]]. During the summer periods as an undergraduate Hershfield worked for the [[Dominion Bridge Company]] in Winnipeg. Upon graduation and until 1932, in conjunction with the Winnipeg City Engineer, he was involved with structural design of bridges, viaducts and subways. Several years later Hershfield continued his education and received the degree of [[Master of Applied Science]] from the University of Toronto in 1950. His masters thesis was titled Series Expansion of Joint Rotations for the Analysis of Rigidly Framed Structures . ==Working life== In 1935 Hershfield moved to [[Toronto, Ontario]] and until 1941 was employed with Standard Iron and Steel Works where his skills and services were focused in [[structural design]], estimating, contracting, detailing and supervision of the fabrication and erection of steel structures. From 1941 to 1943 he was a staff member of the [[Canadian Department of National Defense]], Naval Service, Works and Building Branch as Senior Assistant Engineer, with the rank of Lieutenant. His work during this time included structural design on naval shore establishments including shops, storage facilities, training buildings, and drill halls, of wide variety as to size and materials of construction. After leaving the naval service in 1943, Hershfield joined the staff of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. Hershfield taught a variety of courses related to structural engineering and supervised many graduate students. He was also principal instructor in structural engineering in the [[School of Architecture]] at University of Toronto.OAA Periodical: Charles Hershfield P.Eng.. (March/April 1982). Ontario Association of Architects, p. 5. In 1946 Hershfield, along with [[Carson Morrison]], Joe Millman, and Mark Huggins, responded to the post-war building boom by founding the engineering consulting firm Morrison Hershfield Millman and Huggins. The firm today exists under the name [[Morrison Hershfield]], with offices across North America specializing in multidisciplinary engineering and related expertise.{{cite web|url=http://www.morrisonhershfield.com/aboutus/Pages/OurHistory.aspx|title=Morrison Hershfield History|publisher=Morrison Hershfield|accessdate=2011-01-11}} Hershfield retired from teaching at the University of Toronto in 1976 after 31 years of service but continued to work closely with Morrison Hershfield almost up to the time of his death. ==Notable projects== * Assisted with complex structural design of the roof for the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] Theatre, [[Stratford, Ontario]] (1957) * Designed the complex structural roofing system for the Ontario Pavilion Building at [[Expo 67]], Montreal, Quebec (1967) * Assisted with the expansion of the Toronto [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto|Mount Sinai Hospital]], Toronto, [[Ontario]] * University of Toronto Medical Science Building, Toronto, Ontario ==Awards and achievements== * Elected to the grade of Partner with the Engineering Institute of Canada, 1955. * Member of the Publications Committee, for the Engineering Journal, 197074. * Elected to [[EIC Fellow|Fellow]] of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]], 1974.{{cite web|url=http://www.eic-ici.ca/fellows.html |title=EIC Fellows |publisher=[[Engineering Institute of Canada]] |accessdate={{Format date|2011|2|23}}}} * Consulting Engineer Designation, [[Association of Professional Engineers]], 1974. * Member of the Committee of Examiners, Ontario Association of Architects, 197482 * Member of the [[Canadian Standards Association]] Standards Policy Board, 197778. * Requalifed as a Designated Consulting Engineer, Association of Professional Engineers, 1979. * Awarded the Engineering Medal by the Association of [[Professional Engineers Ontario]], 1982. * Served as a Structural Engineer on the OAA Committee of Examiners, 1982. * Upon his death, the University of Toronto set up the Charles Hershfield Memorial Scholarship fund to acknowledge Hershfield's significant accomplishments as a structural engineer and professor.

His two surviving brothers (four others were killed fighting in 1631) were [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando]] and [[Henry Fairfax (academic)| Henry]]. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] on 5 October 1611,{{acad|id= FRFS611C|name=Fairfax, Charles}} and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 9 March 1618. About 1627 he married Mary, sole heiress of the Breary family, of [[Scough Hall]] in the forest of Knaresborough and Menston. The counsellor and annalist of his family, the rest of his life was spent mainly on his family tree, at [[Menston]], Yorkshire. At Menston he was within a few miles of his paternal home at Denton. ==Civil war== A few days before the [[battle of Marston Moor]] (2 July 1644) Cromwell and other parliamentary leaders held a conference at Fairfax's house at Menston around a table now at [[Farnley Hall, Yorkshire]]. While his nephew, [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas]], afterwards the third Lord Fairfax, did much to preserve the minster and archives at York, Charles was engaged with another antiquary, [[Roger Dodsworth]], in the search for and rescue of books and documents. In 1646 he was appointed by his brother, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando]], the second Lord Fairfax, as steward of the courts at [[Ripon]], and during the later years of the Commonwealth was induced to take service as a Colonel of Foot, a position which he held in [[George Monck]]'s army in Scotland at the time of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660. During Monck's march into Yorkshire he was appointed governor of the town of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]]. This office he held only about a year and then retired to Menston with a pension, granted him by Charles II out of the customs at Hull. ==Death and family== He died in Menston in December 1673. The registers of Fewston parish church record his burial, and also that of his wife in 1657; they were both buried in the Fairfax transept of the parish church at [[Otley]], where there was a mural monument to their memory. Among his children were twin brothers, John, a captain in the army, and [[Henry Fairfax (dean)|Henry]], a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and dean of Norwich, who were so alike as to be indistinguishable by their own mother. ==Written work and collections== Fairfax wrote a work in manuscript entitled ''Analecta Fairfaxiana''. It contains pedigrees, carefully written and blazoned on vellum, of all the branches of the Fairfax family, and of many of the families connected with it, interspersed with many genealogical and literary notes, and about fifty anagrams, epigrams, and elegies in Latin. It went to [[Leeds Castle, Kent]] and then passed into the library of Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]]. Along with several related volumes, tt was acquired by Leeds University Library in 1993.{{cite web|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb206brothertoncollectionmsyks2|title=Analecta Fairfaxiana|publisher=Archives Hub|accessdate=31 December 2011}} By his will, dated 1672, Fairfax bequeathed manuscripts to [[Lincoln's Inn]].{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fairfax, Charles}} ==References== {{reflist}} {{DNB|wstitle=Fairfax, Charles}} {{onesource|date=February 2011}} {{Persondata | NAME = Fairfax, Charles | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = English antiquary | DATE OF BIRTH = 1597 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 1673 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Fairfax, Charles}} [[Category:1597 births]] [[Category:1673 deaths]] [[Category:People from Yorkshire]] [[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge]] [[Category:Roundheads]] [[Category:17th-century English writers]] [[Category:English antiquarians]] [[Category:English genealogists]] [[Category:Fairfax family|Charles]] [[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]] [[Category:17th-century antiquarians]]", "{{Infobox film | name = Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane | image = | image_size = | caption = Film poster | director = [[Girish Karnad]]

The team plays [[Oxford University RFC]] in the annual [[The Varsity Match|Varsity Match]] at [[Twickenham Stadium]] every December. Cambridge players wear light blue and white hooped jerseys with a red lion crest. Many have gone on to represent their country and the [[British and Irish Lions]]; a few, most notably [[Daniel Vickerman|Dan Vickerman]], have represented Cambridge after successful international careers. Whilst at Cambridge University [[James Bevan]] became the first captain of the [[Wales national rugby union team]]. == History == Football is believed to have been introduced to Cambridge University in 1839 by [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] fresher [[Albert Pell]].Marshall (1951), pg 13. Pell had matriculated to Cambridge from [[Rugby School]], where the game of rugby is believed to have originated. Cambridge University Rugby Union Football Club was officially established in 1872, around three years after the Oxford rugby club was founded. The first Varsity match was contested between the two teams on 10 February 1872.Marshall (1951), pg 17. The Cambridge team was led out by captain [[Isaac Cowley Lambert]], wearing pink jerseys with a monogram on the left breast. Played away at the Park in Oxford, Cambridge lost by a single goal to nil. CURUFC officials helped to draw up the laws of the game that were adopted by the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) when it was established in 1871. Cambridge became a Constituent Body of the Union in 1872, a status which the club still holds today. In [[1873-74 Home Nations rugby union matches|1874]], Cambridge provided their first international player directly from the club, when [[John Batten]] represented [[England national rugby union team|England]] in the third encounter against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]].

The Flyers lost in the second round of the playoffs to the [[New Jersey Devils]] in five games. ==Off-season== Following his penchant for making big moves, Flyers General Manager [[Paul Holmgren]] pulled off perhaps the most stunning move of his tenure, trading captain [[Mike Richards]] to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] for [[Brayden Schenn]], [[Wayne Simmonds]] and a 2012 second-round draft pick, as well as [[Jeff Carter]] to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] for their 2011 first-round pick ([[Sean Couturier]]) and [[Jakub Vorácek|Jakub Voracek]], all within the span of an hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]]' [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] to a nine-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed [[Jaromír Jágr|Jaromir Jagr]] to a one-year contract, [[Maxime Talbot]] to a five-year contract and [[Andreas Lilja]] to a two-year contract. ==Regular season== [[Chris Pronger]] was named the Flyers' captain;{{cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=588692 |title=Pronger Named Captain |publisher=Philadelphia Flyers |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2014}} however, 13 games into the season, he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to subpar, including being benched in favor of [[Sergei Bobrovsky]] for the Flyers' 32 loss to the [[New York Rangers]] in the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic|2012 Winter Classic]]. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Sean Couturier, Brayden Schenn and [[Matt Read]] standing out impressively.
